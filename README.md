- Project:
- Trello Board: https://trello.com/b/bPKDmSHs/project-1
- GitHub: https://github.com/idecay/Project-1

## Overview

This project was assigned to evaluate the skills we have learned in HTML, CSS and Javascript. I chose to create a version of Jeopardy using a mix of questions and categories from the show, as well as, a category that specifically address this SEI class.

## How to Play

Begin by selecting a point value underneath its corresponding category. Select the correct answer from the drop down menu and click submit. If your answer is correct a pop up will be displayed saying "Nice job!" and the points will be added to your score in the top left of the screen. Likewise, if you answer wrong, then that amount of points will be educted from your total.
